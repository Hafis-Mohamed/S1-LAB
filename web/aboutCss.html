        <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>

        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify
            the process of making web pages presentable.</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents by prescribing colors,
                fonts, spacing, and positioning.</li>
            <li>
                The main advantages are the separation of content (in HTML) and styling
                (in CSS) and the same CSS rules can be used across all pages and not have to be rewritten.</li>
            <li>
                HTML uses tags, and CSS uses rule sets.</li>
            <li>
                CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Why CSS?</h1>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Saves Time: Write CSS once and reuse it across multiple HTML pages.</li>
            <li>
                Easy Maintenance: Change the style globally with a single modification.</li>
            <li>
                Search Engine Friendly: Clean coding technique that improves readability for search engines.</li>
            <li>
                Superior Styles: Offers a wider array of attributes compared to HTML.</li>
            <li>
                Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally using an offline cache, allowing offline
                viewing.
            </li>

        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used to style web pages written in HTML. It
            allows developers to control the visual appearance of elements like text, images, and layouts without
            changing the HTML structure. By linking a CSS file or embedding CSS directly in HTML, designers can separate
            content from design, making websites easier to maintain and update. CSS rules consist of selectors and
            declarations, where selectors target HTML elements, and declarations define styles such as color, font size,
            and spacing. It supports various units like pixels, percentages, and ems to control sizing. CSS also enables
            adding backgrounds, borders, and animations to enhance user experience. It is supported by all modern
            browsers, making it essential for web development. Learning CSS is often the first step in front-end web
            development, enabling creativity and functionality.</p>

    <div id="selectors">
        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
        <center><img class="imgcont" src="https://studyopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CSS-Selectors.png" alt="">
        </center>
        <p>Selectors are the core of CSS, used to pinpoint which HTML elements a set of style rules should apply to.
            There are many types of selectors, including element selectors that target tags like
            <i> <b>P, H1</b></i>, class selectors that use a period followed by a class name (e.g., .button), and ID
            selectors that use a
            hash symbol and an ID name <i>(e.g., #header).</i> Combinators like descendant selectors (div p) apply
            styles based
            on hierarchy. Pseudo-classes like <i><b>:hover</b></i> or <i><b>:nth-child()</b></i> allow styling elements
            based on their state or
            position. Attribute selectors target elements with specific attributes, such as <i><b>[type="text"]</b></i>.
            Understanding
            selectors is vital to write precise CSS rules and avoid unwanted styles cascading to other elements. The
            specificity of selectors determines which styles override others when conflicts arise. Mastery of selectors
            leads to efficient and maintainable stylesheets.

    <div id="boxmodel">
        <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>

        <center><img class="imgcont" src="https://teachyourselfcoding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-3.png" alt=""></center>
        <p>The CSS box model is a critical concept that describes how elements are rendered on a page. Every HTML
            element is represented as a rectangular box comprising four parts: content, padding, border, and margin. The
            content area holds text or images, padding creates space inside the element, the border surrounds the
            padding, and the margin creates space outside the border separating the element from others. Understanding
            the box model is important for controlling layout and spacing precisely. For example, adding padding
            increases the size of the element visually, but does not affect the margin between elements. Borders can be
            styled with color, width, and pattern. Margins can collapse in vertical directions, a unique behavior
            important to grasp for layout consistency. The <i><b>box-sizing</b></i> property can change how widths and
            heights are
            calculated, typically set to <i><b>border-box</b></i> for easier sizing control.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="flexbox">

        <h1>CSS Flexbox</h1>

        <center><img class="imgcont" src="https://images.viblo.asia/full/f53dfbcb-a7c1-417e-9c2e-6e3dd6a02378.png" alt=""></center>
        <p>Flexbox, short for flexible box layout, is a powerful CSS module designed to arrange elements within a
            container efficiently. It works by defining a flex container with <i><b>display: flex;</b></i> and then
            controlling the
            layout of its children. Flexbox allows items to grow, shrink, or wrap based on available space, making it
            perfect for responsive designs. Key properties include <i><b>justify-content</b></i> for horizontal
            alignment, <b><i>align-items</i></b>
            for vertical alignment, and <i><b>flex-direction</b></i> to set row or column layouts. Flexbox simplifies
            vertical
            centering, a traditionally tricky task in CSS. It also supports reordering items visually without changing
            the HTML structure. Because of its adaptability, Flexbox is widely used in modern web layouts, such as
            navigation bars, card grids, and form controls. Learning Flexbox significantly improves front-end
            developers’ ability to create fluid and responsive interfaces.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="grid">

        <h1>CSS Grid</h1>

        <center><img class="imgcont" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExOkpqCG20g/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></center>
        <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows developers to create complex and responsive web
            layouts with ease. Unlike Flexbox, which is mainly one-dimensional (row or column), Grid works both
            vertically and horizontally. Defining a grid container with <i><b>display: grid;</b></i> lets you specify
            rows and columns
            using <i><b>grid-template-rows</b></i> and <i><b>grid-template-columns</b></i>. You can place items
            explicitly in specific grid cells or
            areas, giving designers fine control over layout. Grid supports features like gaps between rows and columns
            (<i><b>grid-gap</b></i>), auto-placement, and alignment controls. It is ideal for building full-page
            layouts, dashboards,
            and magazine-style designs. CSS Grid has gained massive popularity due to its power and simplicity compared
            to older techniques like floats and tables. Combining Grid with media queries enables flexible, responsive
            designs that adapt beautifully to different screen sizes.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="trans">

        <h1>CSS Transitions and Animations</h1>

        <center><img class="imgcont" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*wUF_TVxvkTk0j6LulG9gww.jpeg" alt=""></center>
        <p>CSS transitions and animations bring interactivity and smooth visual effects to web pages without needing
            JavaScript. Transitions enable gradual changes of CSS properties over time, triggered by events like hover
            or focus. For example, changing a button’s background color smoothly when hovered creates a polished effect.
            You define transitions using properties like <i><b>transition-property, transition-duration, </b></i>and
            <i><b>
                    transition-timing-function</b></i>. Animations allow more complex, multi-step sequences, defined
            with <i><b>@keyframes</b></i>,
            specifying intermediate styles at different percentages. Animations can loop, reverse, or play once, adding
            life to elements like loaders, sliders, or page transitions. Both transitions and animations improve user
            experience by making UI changes feel natural and responsive. Learning how to combine these tools unlocks
            creative design possibilities without performance-heavy scripts.
        </p>

    <div id="resp">

        <h1>Responsive Designing</h1>

        <center><img class="imgcont" src="https://colorwhistle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/responsive-web-design-why-it-matters.jpg" alt=""></center>

        <p>Responsive design is a CSS approach that ensures web pages look and function well on devices of all sizes,
            from smartphones to desktops. This is achieved using media queries, which apply different CSS rules based on
            device characteristics like screen width, height, resolution, or orientation. For example, you can change
            font sizes, layout structures, or hide certain elements on smaller screens. Flexible units like percentages,
            ems, and viewport units <i><b>(vw and vh)</b></i> are used instead of fixed pixel values to create adaptable
            designs.
            Responsive images, flexible grids, and scalable typography contribute to usability and accessibility.
            Mobile-first design is a common strategy where styles are initially designed for small screens, then
            enhanced for larger devices. Responsive design improves user experience and is critical in modern web
            development due to the diversity of internet-connected devices.</p>
